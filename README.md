Exercises I did while following The Odin Project

## Foundation Course

1. Landing page

- the 4 boxes of images was not correct ie was not spaced correctly
- responsiveness was missing, had to chatgpt for it because did not know how to do it
- Below is the result with boxes outlined. The final result does not have these boxes/borders.

- to practice JS, nothing special (just an exercise)
- Below is the result

- Below is the result

4. Calculator

- Decided not to do calculator game -> figured not worth and I won't play it after I am done with it
- Instead made a receipt calculator and made the project public (check it out since my thoughts/summary is in that repo)

## Node.js Course

1. Sign-up form (not connected to backend, done for practice)

2. Dashboard (no backend, done for practice but design used for portfolio website)
- problem: responsiveness (items in grid go out of the grid when window size becomes smaller)
- problem: text in flexbox (can't put a lot otherwise will push buttons outside the textbox)
- basically had to hardcode which is not good and website only looks good at 1980x1080
- Below is the result
